#### 1. Introduction

#### 2. Setting up your editor

We've adopted some packages to enforce coding-style, formatting and to prevent bad git commit/push MRs.

Everything is set in the project's *package.json*.

However, if you are new to programming adventures you may want to configure some code editor add-ons to have a better visual experience.

**VSCODE extensions to install:**

1. Babel JavaScript	
2. ESLint
3. Debugger for Chrome
4. Prettier - Code formatter
5. Formatting Toggle (allows you to enable/disable prettier

If you want to know more about what we're talking about:
	
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/editors/): Babel is a JavaScript compiler. Use next generation JavaScript, today. 
	
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/): ESLint is an open source project originally created by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. Its goal is to provide a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript 

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) An opinionated code formatter. Supports many languages. Integrates with most editors.

[Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) : Husky can prevent bad git commit, git push and more üê∂ woof!
